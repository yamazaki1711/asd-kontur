# OZERO Comprehensive Tender Goal

## Objective

Deliver comprehensive, persistent, evidence-backed PD understanding and usable Tender analysis for
the existing OZERO workspace `01a088aa-0491-7bdd-9127-8359fe927a27`. The result must cover the
complete uploaded package, including every identifiable local area, LOS, KNS, associated excavation,
structure, work scope, quantities, materials, requirements, cross-document disagreement, and missing
information. It is a Tender delivery through shared ASD-KONTUR architecture, not a ProductReady claim.

## Authority and boundaries

Codex implements software, migrations, tests, controlled releases, and orchestration. Local
Qwen3.8-27B performs model-based OCR/VLM, semantic interpretation, engineering extraction, and
consultant generation. Deterministic local code handles native extraction, rendering, splitting,
validation, indexing, and reproducible calculations. Do not use cloud inference, Apple Vision,
Tesseract, or Codex inference as substitutes for Qwen document interpretation.

Keep engineering reports and commits in English. Keep UI and consultant responses in Russian. Preserve
the workspace, source versions, original failed turn `01a088c6-a7a0-7fb4-8a64-732bac76b362`, candidate
authority, evidence provenance, RLS, historical attempts, and unrelated worktree changes. Do not merge
to main, reset OZERO, weaken access controls, or repeat accepted OCR without a demonstrated defect.

## Programme and acceptance

1. Account for every active document, revision, page, meaningful region, and processing disposition.
   Native extraction, visual interpretation, semantic analysis, and reconciliation have separate
   denominators. A successful historical job is not semantic coverage.
2. Build connected reusable entities for the project, locations, LOS/KNS, structures, pits, works,
   quantities, materials, interfaces, and construction dependencies. Preserve containment, location,
   functional connection, and dependency separately. Keep ambiguous links and unresolved observations.
3. Provide evidence-backed dossiers for each identified facility and local area, including aliases,
   purpose, location references, constituent elements, supported dimensions/levels/conditions,
   construction solution, work/material scope, interfaces, source revisions, contradictions, and gaps.
4. Reconcile evidence across disciplines for Tender findings, clarification questions, scope uncertainty,
   potential omissions, and constructability risks. The preliminary sheet-pile/waling-beam business
   scope remains unawarded until sources and authority establish otherwise.
5. Publish Russian project navigation: project → local area → facility → structures/pits → works/materials
   → evidence. Publish honest partial coverage and candidate status; never present no-analysis as zero.
6. Connect the consultant to structured inventory plus evidence. It must support project-wide/local
   questions, comparisons, follow-ups, and exhaustive inventories only where coverage supports them.
7. Accept only after all active pages are accounted for, eligible analysis completes, local-area/LOS/KNS
   dossiers reconcile, relationships survive batch/document boundaries, Tender findings are traceable,
   30 substantive package-wide consultant questions pass, reload/restart/isolation pass, and deployed
   API/UI/worker versions are compatible.

## Current baseline and next action

The package has 22 active source versions and 2,529 pages. V1 engineering extraction of one 60-page
source completed with 2,154 accepted locator fragments and partial candidates; this is preserved evidence,
not full-package acceptance. Database migration `0039_engineering_batches` is live. Commit `fbb7131`
contains the versioned v2 extraction correction but is not deployed at this checkpoint.

Next: qualify/deploy the v2 worker without interrupting unrelated workloads, select the next eligible
structural/site source-version through the existing durable lifecycle, and verify source → Qwen →
candidate → project view → evidence path before expanding the queue. Continue the complete package and
all programme steps above; do not close this goal on an intermediate counter, patch, or model.
